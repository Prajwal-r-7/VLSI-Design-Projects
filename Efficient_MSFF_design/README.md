# ‚ö° Efficient Master-Slave Flip-Flop (MSFF) Design

## üìã Project Overview

This project focuses on designing a **low-power Master-Slave Flip-Flop (MSFF)** circuit with optimized **Energy-Delay Product (EDP)** through systematic transistor sizing and timing optimization. The design aims to minimize delay while maintaining functional stability and area efficiency.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- **NGSpice** - Circuit simulation and analysis
- **BSIM Models** - Accurate transistor modeling

## üéØ Design Objectives

- Achieve minimum combined **setup time** and **clock-to-Q delay**
- Optimize **Energy-Delay Product (EDP)** for both rising and falling transitions
- Maintain functional stability across process variations
- Ensure area efficiency in the final design

## üìä Design Methodology

### 1. EDP Optimization Analysis
- **Transistor Sizing**: Systematically varied the width of sensitive transistors across a defined range
- **Transition Analysis**: Analyzed both rising and falling edge transitions
- **Worst-Case Selection**: Selected the maximum EDP between rising and falling transitions as the design constraint

### 2. Multi-Metric EDP Evaluation
Evaluated different EDP formulations to understand trade-offs:
- **ED‚Å¥** - Higher emphasis on delay optimization
- **ED¬≤** - Balanced energy-delay trade-off
- **ED‚Å∞¬∑‚Å∏** - Moderate energy emphasis
- **ED‚Å∞¬∑‚Å∂** - Higher emphasis on energy optimization

### 3. Energy vs Delay Visualization
Created comprehensive **Energy vs Delay** graphs with marked points showing:
- **Left Side**: Higher ED values (ED‚Å¥, ED¬≤) - delay-weighted optimization
- **Right Side**: Lower ED values (ED‚Å∞¬∑‚Å∏, ED‚Å∞¬∑‚Å∂) - energy-weighted optimization

### 4. Power Analysis & Comparison
- **Power vs Activity Factor**: Analyzed power consumption across different switching activities
- **Comparative Analysis**: Benchmarked MSFF design against:
  - **SAFF** (Sense Amplifier Flip-Flop)
  - **HLFF** (Hybrid Latch Flip-Flop)
